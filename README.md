TrojanOrdering

Welcome to TrojanOrdering, a web application designed to streamline food delivery for students on the USC campus. This application allows users to pool their orders from the same location, reducing delivery costs and making the process more efficient. 

*Features:
- User authentication: Users can create an account or log in using their username and password.
- Home page: The main page displays a list of restaurants/fast food chains around USC, along with the user's wallet balance. Users can click on a restaurant to view its menu.
- Restaurant page: Each restaurant has its own page with a complete menu. Users can add items to their cart and specify quantities.
- Checkout page: Users can modify their cart, choose a delivery time, and place their order. The page validates the user's balance and empties the cart upon successful checkout.
